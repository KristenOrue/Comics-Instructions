          <hr>
          <p>My name is Kristen Orue and I <strong>LOVE</strong> Comic books.
            The comic book live action movie is now mainstream and with the success of multiple comic book stories, comes great responsibility. 
            Most of my friends do not read comic books, but whenever we go to a comic book movie they ask: “How does it compare to the comic book?” 
            followed by “Will you recommend some for me?”     
            I created this site as guide to anyone who has ever asked these questions and wants to
            find some answers. I hope you eventually love comics as much as I do.
            Let the search Begin! </p>

<h2 class="homepage">2. Click on the sites provided in the Navigation Bar</h2>
<p>There are a variety of Comic Book Publishers. Marvel and DC Comics are the most recognisable, but there is also a variety of publishers 
which are independently owned and tend to release artist's passion projects such as Image Comics, Dark Horse Comics, and BOOM Studios.
Overall, the stories released by the independently owned publishers have more diversity. Artists and writers can go in whatever direction
they want which can include a serial killer who's fetish is to bite people's nails into their fingers, a video game character from a Horror
themed game accidently ends up in fairyland and has to adjust, to very real stories about political termoil in the past referencing today's political
climate or a Muslim woman who is being discriminated against and is also haunted by a demon. The variety of the outlandish to very real human stories is out there 
just waiting to be read and enjoyed by you, whatever your taste may be.  </p>
<p>I provided links to the the main Comic Book publishers. Click around and do your research.  </p>
<hr>

<h2 class="homepage">3. Explore!</h2>
<p>These sites are where the publishers showcase new releases and old books that the publisher feel are still worth reading. For example, 
when I started reading comics, I started from a new storyline and missed all of the beautifully written and drawn comics of the old days 
which were recommended to me later on so simply write down what you think is ascetically appealing.</p>
<hr>

<h2 class="homepage">4. Take Notes</h2>
<p>Take a note either on your phone or on a piece of paper and write down which characters or artwork stands out to you. Everyone is different
(Thank goodness!) in their taste and this will help narrow down yours. Write down the artists or the author if the storyline sounds like 
something you’d be interested in. </p>
<hr>

<h2 class="homepage">5. Find your Local Comic Shop</h2>
<p>Click on the image below to find your local Comic book shop… 
    <hr>
       <a href="https://www.comicshoplocator.com/Home/1/1/57/575">

       <hr>
       <hr>

<p>NOTE: Wednesdays is New comic book day so if you want time to discuss your selections, receive feedback, and perhaps other recommendations 
 from your friendly neighborhood comic book employee DO NOT GO ON A WEDNESDAY. It is extremely busy. Comic books with an active storyline 
 are released monthly just like magazine subscriptions and it could be any one of those Wednesdays. </p>

<hr>
<h2 class="homepage">6. Talk to a Human</h2>
<p>Once you arrive at your local Comic Book shop talk to the person working there. Mention that you’re new to comics and provide 
    him/her with the list of comics you’ve already shown an interest in. They will be able to guide you in the right direction from there.</p>
    <hr>
<p>If you walk in empty handed they could be a bit biased based on their own taste</p>

<img src="https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/benedict-cumberbatch-600-5.jpg?w=600" alt="Doctor Strage">
<hr>
<hr>
<p>However, show them a list and they'll show you more like it and get you started with a trade paperback edition instead of a storyline that you may
have to work on catching up to enjoy.</p>


<h2 class="homepage">7. Check your library</h2>
<p>If you are only interested in those comic books that you selected, check your local library first they usually have quite the variety 
    and you’ll be surprised by what they have to offer. Here in Bend, OR search the website… 
    <a href="https://www.deschuteslibrary.org/" alt="Dechutes County Library"></a>
</p>

<h2 class="homepage">8. Pick what YOU like</h2>
<p>An important rule of picking your very first comic book story: DO NOT pick a comic book because you think it will be worth something someday. 
    The comic books that are worth something one day are the ones that nobody imagines will be worth something one day. Just take good care of whatever 
    storyline you find interesting. </p>

<h2 class="homepage">9. HAVE FUN!</h2>
<p>Most importantly, HAVE FUN! Appreciate the fact that a writer had a story to tell alongside a vision in mind handed it over to  
an artist and allowed them to completely take over the story through visualization. It’s a fun and beautiful relationship.
Buy one book and if you like it, Buy more. If you don't like it, don't buy more and pick something else. 
<br>In conclusion, this is exciting for people like me who already love comics but, I certainly
have my fair share of comics I didn't enjoy no different than some novels that sounded great and were simply underwhelming. I hope this set of instructions helps and that you've had fun! </p>

      <p>My parents are from Peru and Cuba, <br>Comic books are not something they have ever found remotely interesting or useful. I love reading because my mother encouraged the arts and classics. Education was and still is the most important tool for two people who moved to an entirely different coutry at age 20 in search of a better life for themselves and their children. I was allowed to watch "Much Ado about Nothing" and "Amistad" because they're educational but "Jurassic Park" at age 13 was a no go. That being said my best friends Jonathan Zimmer his wife Theresa introduced me to a whole new world first by taking me to Star Wars Celebration. I was hooked. The creativity and imagination required for buiding a lightsaber out of $20.00 worth of spare tools at a hardware store. I felt like a kid again. Then, we went to my first comic book store where I left with a pile of books to enjoy which I thought would include lots of "pow!", "Gee Goly Batman", and Spiderman saying, "High five! Oops! I guess you're stuck with me"...althought the Spiderman one may be a direct quote. Instead, it was right up my alley: analysing the light and darkness found in humanity (you either die a hero or live to become the villain ), exploring family dynamics, mental illness, political isses, etc. you name a theme from a classic novel and I'll name a comic book that delves into the same theme. At comic con panels authors discuss what they were going through when writing that book or how "Lazarus" a book about a future world run by the 6 richest families controlling resources where a bionic woman named Forever Carlyle is a weapon created by one of the families and doesn't know it, is really about the author's exploration of nature versus nurture. I also gained an appreciation for the complexities behind the relationship between an author and the artist. An author had to hand his/her writing over to an artist and say, "express what's in my mind" and somehow it happens, sometimes with ease and sometimes with a year of banter but everytime it's a masterpiece. For me the ultimate combination was using my own creativity and ingenuity to create a costume. I love going to comic cons for many reasons but asking a 17 year old dressed like Pennywise to take a picture only to hear a high pitched sweet little voice say, "yea sure" followed by posing like a murderous terrifying clown is the main reason.  </p>
